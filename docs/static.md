# Static Pages Tutorial

This tutorial assumes youâ€™ve downloaded CodeIgniter and installed the framework in your development environment.

## Make our First Controller

- Create a file at `app/Controllers/Pages.php` with following code:

- Make a file name Pages.php and copy paste below code in your Pages.php file:

- Run one command at a time.

- if you folder name is different from ci rename it as ci to use furthure commands:

```console
cd
cd /var/www/html/ 
sudo mv your-file-name ci

- now check your folder is renamed or not by navigating /var/www/html/.

```console
cd
cd /var/www/html/ci/app/Controllers/
touch Pages.php
```

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controllers;

class Pages extends BaseController
{
    public function index()
    {
        return view('welcome_message');
    }

    public function view($page = 'home')
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

```
- Now make file name footer.php

```console
